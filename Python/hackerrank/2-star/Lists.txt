Consider a list(list = []).
You can perform the following commands:
1. insert i e: insert integer e at position 1.
2. print: print the list.
3. remove e: delete the first occurence of integer e
4. append e: insert integer e at the end of the list
5. sort: sort the list 
6. pop: pop the last element form the list
7. reverse: reverse the list

Intialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above.
Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

Example:
N = 4
append 1
append 2
insert 3 1
print 
* append 1: append 1 to the list, arr = [1]
* append 2: append 2 to the list, arr = [1, 2]
* insert 3 1: insert 3 at index 1, arr = [1, 3, 2]
* print: print the array
Output:
[1, 3, 2]

Input Format 
The first line contains an integer, n , denoting the number of commands.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above.

Constraints
* The elements added to the list must be integers
