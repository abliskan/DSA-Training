Task
Given an integer, n , and n space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, t , of those  integers. 
Then compute and print the result of hash(t)

note: hash() is one of the functions in the __builtins__ module, so it need not be imported.

Input format 
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in the tuple.
The second line contains n space-separted integers describing the elements in tuple.
