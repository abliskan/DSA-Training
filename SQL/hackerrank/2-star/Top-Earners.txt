We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

Input format
The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

Column      | Type
----------------------------
employee_id | integer
name        | string
months      | integer
salary      | integer
where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and salary is the their monthly salary.

Sample Input
employee_id | name | months | salary
------------------------------------------
12228 | rose     | 15 | 1968
33645 | angela   | 1  | 3443
45692 | frank    | 17 | 1608
56118 | patrick  | 17 | 1608 
59725 | lisa     | 11 | 2330
74197 | kimberly | 16 | 4372
83565 | bonnie   | 8  | 1771
98607 | todd     | 5  | 3396
99989 | joe      | 9  | 3573

Sample Output
69952 1
The maximum earnings value is 69952. 
The only employee with earnings = 69952 is Kimberly, so we print the maximum earnings value (69952) and a count of the number of employees who have earned  (which is 1) as two space-separated values.
